# VisualDisturbances
All code for Bucknell's Visual Disturbances project.

# Update 9/28: 
Uploading this to GitHub.  If one wishes to recreate these results, they'll need to add in their own file paths -- these are specific to my directories.  Data will NOT be released yet.  When it is I'll update the file paths so these files will work directly from GitHub.

# Update 11/28:
Data added and comments updated.  We're expecting this iteration of the code to be released upon submission of the paper.
File paths have been updated in the code to actually work straight for file directory used for GitHub page.
