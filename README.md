# VisualDisturbances
All code for Bucknell's Visual Disturbances project.

# Update 9/28: 
Uploading this to GitHub.  If one wishes to recreate these results, they'll need to add in their own file paths -- these are specific to my directories.  Data will NOT be released yet.  When it is I'll update the file paths so these files will work directly from GitHub.

# Update 11/28:
Data added and comments updated.  We're expecting this iteration of the code to be released upon submission of the paper.
MAJOR NOTE --> Raw data was too large to put on GitHub.  Currently looking into alternate ways to add it.
