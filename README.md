Overview
========

Code implementations of the visualizations in the video essay [Visual Disturbances](http://mediacommons.org/intransition/visual-disturbances).  This work was recently extended into an article that was accepted to [Projections](https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/projections/projections-overview.xml) (see citation below).

A majority of the visuals were done with the pygame package in python; a majority of the data analysis/manipulation was done with general R tools.  During our exploratory development of the paper, we attempted some novel applications of the [DiProPerm](https://pypi.org/project/diproperm/) method.  While this implementation was cut from the final draft, it is still included here.

If one wishes to recreate these results, they'll need to add in their own file paths -- these are specific to my directories.  Furthermore, as of January 2021, the data is not available for public use.  If one wishes to have access, please reach out to me and I will see if this is possible.

Packages Required
============

R packages: ggplot2, beepr <br>
python packages: pygame, csv, matplotlib, diproperm
